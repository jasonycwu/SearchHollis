They extol the virtues of Illinois as an agricultural state ; discuss the Mormons' expulsion from Nauvoo, the Mexican War, railroad matters, political developments, appointments, slavery, and secession ; include autobiographical sketches ; and accept Lincoln's challenge and set up the arrangements for the now famous Lincoln-Douglas debates in the U.S. senatorial campaign of 1858. -- from inside jacket flap."

Corresponding to the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen, the 21-cm line is sensitive to the temperature and ionization state of the cosmic gas, as well as to cosmological parameters. Crucially, with the development of new interferometers it will allow us to map out the first billion years of our universe, enabling us to learn about the properties of the unseen first generations of galaxies. Rapid progress is being made on both the observational and theoretical fronts, and important decisions on techniques and future direction are being made. The Cosmic 21-cm Revolution gathers contributions from current leaders in this fast-moving field, providing both an overview for graduate students and a reference point for current researchers."
